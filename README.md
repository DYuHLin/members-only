# members-only
With this project it was mostly similar to the previous projects I had done pertaining to node and mongoDB. What was new is the use of passport to create users, login and registration and the use of bcrypt to encrypt the password. It was a bit of a challenge at first but I think with more practice I will have a much better grasp of using passport.
